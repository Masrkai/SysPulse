    #? FetchContent step builds it via Corrosion, which needs a working
    #? cargo/rustc on PATH. There's no plain `slint` nixpkg for this

    #? search path -- needs them exported via LD_LIBRARY_PATH below, not

    #? find them.

  #? Let me Explain why is this needed
  #? perf utility isn't a package in fact it's a kernel utility in linux

  #? And for
  #! /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict
  #? it's to profile Kernel Calls

  #* In A technical sense of security you would
  #* never allow this on a "production" or "daily driver" machine
  #* As I am very conscious of this yet i need it for profiling
  #* A temporary solution would be enabling them in a shell temporarily then re-disabling them
  #* Sadly this can't be done in a shell and instead done system-wide so i need you to realize understand and evaluate
  #* the Risks comes with this
